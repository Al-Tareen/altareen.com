## When to use
When you must choose a model/prompt approach and need a repeatable, defensible way to compare options.

## Inputs required
Golden set; metrics definitions; baseline approach; acceptance thresholds; test harness.

## Output artifact
Eval plan; scorecards; ship/no-ship thresholds; comparison results.

## Common mistakes
No thresholds; metrics don’t match user value; offline-only; no baseline comparison.
