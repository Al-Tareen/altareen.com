## When to use
When users sign up but don’t reach “aha”—you need a path to value.

## Inputs required
Activation definition; top user paths; friction points; instrumented funnel.

## Output artifact
Onboarding flow plan + experiments + activation targets.

## Common mistakes
Teaching features not outcomes; no segmentation; no measurement.
