## When to use
When scope is ballooning and you need the smallest version that can validate value.

## Inputs required
Value hypothesis; constraints; riskiest assumptions; timeline; must-have UX path.

## Output artifact
MVP scope; excluded scope; learning goal; success metric; next iteration plan.

## Common mistakes
MVP becomes “mini full product”; cuts the wrong things; no learning goal.
