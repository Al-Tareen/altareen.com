## When to use
When alignment is fragile and you need to manage influence, incentives, and resistance.

## Inputs required
Stakeholder list; influence level; incentives; concerns; history/conflicts.

## Output artifact
Stakeholder map + engagement plan (who, when, how).

## Common mistakes
Ignoring incentives; not updated; mapping without action.
