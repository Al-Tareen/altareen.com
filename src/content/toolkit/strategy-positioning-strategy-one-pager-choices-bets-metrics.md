## When to use
When you’re planning the next quarter/half and must choose 3–5 bets with clear tradeoffs and metrics.

## Inputs required
Vision; ICP; top constraints; candidate bets; evidence; metric baselines; known risks.

## Output artifact
Strategic choices (what we will/won’t do); 3–5 bets; owners; metrics + guardrails; kill criteria.

## Common mistakes
Too many bets; no explicit “won’t do”; metrics not tied to bets; no kill criteria.
