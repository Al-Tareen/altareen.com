## When to use
When you’re considering an AI feature and you’re not 100% sure you have the right data (or a viable plan to get it).

## Inputs required
Target use cases/tasks; current data inventory (what exists + access); data gaps; privacy/security constraints; labeling/collection options; ownership/stewardship; expected data volume/refresh needs.

## Output artifact
1-page data plan covering: required data sources, acquisition/labeling approach, governance/permissions, quality criteria, refresh cadence, and top risks + mitigations.

## Common mistakes
Treating it like a wish list; unclear ownership/access; ignoring privacy/compliance; no plan for labeling/quality; no timeline/cost estimate.
