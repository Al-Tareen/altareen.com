## When to use
When success is being debated or you have too many metrics and no single “win condition.”

## Inputs required
Value model (how users get value); retention drivers; baseline metrics; instrumentation reality.

## Output artifact
North Star metric; input metrics; guardrails; review cadence.

## Common mistakes
Vanity metric; not causally linked to value; no guardrails; not measurable with current telemetry.
