## When to use
When you’re launching a production AI feature and need an “on-call plan” for safety, quality, or data incidents.

## Inputs required
Alert triggers; rollback plan; comms plan; escalation list; logging access.

## Output artifact
Incident SOP; severity matrix; containment steps; post-incident review steps.

## Common mistakes
No rollback; unclear comms; slow escalation; no postmortem actions.
