## When to use
When outcomes take time and you need early signals you’re on track.

## Inputs required
KPI tree; time-to-impact; historical correlations (if available).

## Output artifact
Leading indicators list with justification + validation plan.

## Common mistakes
“Leading” indicators that don’t predict outcomes; no validation.
