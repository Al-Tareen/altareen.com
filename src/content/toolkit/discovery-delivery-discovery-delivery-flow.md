## When to use
When your team lacks a shared process and work is getting stuck in handoffs or unclear stages.

## Inputs required
Team roles; delivery cadence; handoffs; required artifacts; tooling reality.

## Output artifact
Stage map; artifacts per stage; owner per handoff; gates/checklists.

## Common mistakes
Over-engineered process; not adopted; unclear ownership; gates not enforced.
