## When to use
When engineers ask “what do you want tracked?” and you need an event-level plan.

## Inputs required
KPI tree; event taxonomy; privacy rules; analytics tools constraints.

## Output artifact
Event spec (events + properties); dashboard mapping; QA plan.

## Common mistakes
Instrumenting everything; missing key properties; privacy violations; no QA.
