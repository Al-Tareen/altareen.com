## When to use
When UX quality and trust matter as much as growth (common for AI assistants/copilots).

## Inputs required
UX goals; behavioral proxies; survey method; trust/safety needs.

## Output artifact
HEART metric set + mapping to events/surveys.

## Common mistakes
Surveys only; no behavioral linkage; too many metrics.
