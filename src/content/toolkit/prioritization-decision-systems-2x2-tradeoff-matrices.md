## When to use
When you have more work than capacity and need a consistent way to rank backlog items.

## Inputs required
Meaningful axes; options list; constraints; data to place options.

## Output artifact
2x2 map; decision; rationale; follow-up tests.

## Common mistakes
Fake axes; forced conclusions; no evidence behind placements.
