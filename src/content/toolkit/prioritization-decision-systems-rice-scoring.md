## When to use
When you have more work than capacity and need a consistent way to rank backlog items.

## Inputs required
Reach/Impact/Confidence/Effort estimates; standard scoring definitions.

## Output artifact
Ranked backlog; scoring rationale; sensitivity notes.

## Common mistakes
Gaming numbers; false precision; inconsistent definitions; ignores strategy fit.
