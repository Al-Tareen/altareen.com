## When to use
When you must choose between initiatives and need to justify ROI with costs + uncertainty.

## Inputs required
Build + run costs; benefit hypothesis; time horizon; confidence levels; dependencies.

## Output artifact
ROI table; sensitivity analysis; recommended option + assumptions.

## Common mistakes
Inflated benefits; ignores ongoing costs; no confidence ranges; no sensitivity.
