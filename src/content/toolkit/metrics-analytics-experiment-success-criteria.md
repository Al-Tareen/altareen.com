## When to use
When you’re running tests and want to prevent moving goalposts after results show up.

## Inputs required
Hypothesis; baseline; MDE/thresholds; guardrails; timeframe.

## Output artifact
Pre-defined ship/iterate/kill decision rules.

## Common mistakes
No thresholds; adjusting thresholds after results; ignores guardrails.
