## When to use
When you’re launching or sharing an AI capability and need to document intended use, limits, and risks.

## Inputs required
Intended use; limitations; eval results; safety risks; data handling; deployment details.

## Output artifact
System card (what it does/doesn’t; risks; mitigations; metrics; change history).

## Common mistakes
Sanitized marketing doc; missing limitations; not updated after changes.
