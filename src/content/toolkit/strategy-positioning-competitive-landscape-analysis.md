## When to use
When you need a defensible differentiation and people keep saying “Competitor X already does this.”

## Inputs required
Competitor + substitutes list; pricing/packaging; positioning; distribution channels; win/loss or user feedback.

## Output artifact
Competitive map; differentiation thesis; wedge strategy; risks + counters.

## Common mistakes
Feature checklist only; ignoring substitutes; outdated intel; no action implications.
