## When to use
When decisions keep getting revisited and you need a single source of truth for “what we decided and why.”

## Inputs required
Decision context; options; criteria; evidence; dissent; owner.

## Output artifact
Decision record with “what would change our mind” + revisit date.

## Common mistakes
No criteria; no evidence; never revisited; decisions made “by vibe.”
