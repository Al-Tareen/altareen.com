## When to use
When you need quarterly alignment on outcomes and ownership across teams.

## Inputs required
Strategy one-pager; baseline metrics; ownership; review cadence.

## Output artifact
OKRs with owners; targets; check-in schedule.

## Common mistakes
Output-based KRs; too many; no baseline; no owner.
