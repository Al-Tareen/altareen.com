## When to use
When you suspect the model may hallucinate, jailbreak, or produce unsafe outputs—and you need to test it before launch.

## Inputs required
Abuse prompts; adversarial scenarios; policy rules; golden set; known failure modes.

## Output artifact
Red-team suite; results; fixes; re-test cadence.

## Common mistakes
Only testing normal users; no jailbreak attempts; no retest after fixes.
