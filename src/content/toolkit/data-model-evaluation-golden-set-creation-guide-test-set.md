## When to use
When quality is subjective and you need a stable test set to prevent “it feels better” arguments.

## Inputs required
Representative cases; edge cases; labeling guidelines; adjudication process; version control.

## Output artifact
Curated test set; labeling rubric; dataset versions; coverage report.

## Common mistakes
Biased sampling; missing edge cases; label inconsistency; not versioned.
