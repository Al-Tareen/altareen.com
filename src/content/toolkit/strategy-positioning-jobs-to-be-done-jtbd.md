## When to use
When user needs are unclear, or users describe goals in messy, inconsistent ways.

## Inputs required
Real situations (triggers + context); interview notes; desired outcomes; alternatives; emotional/social drivers.

## Output artifact
JTBD statements; outcome drivers; “forces” (push/pull/anxiety/habit); prioritized jobs list.

## Common mistakes
Turning jobs into features; ignoring context; no prioritization; relying on internal opinions.
