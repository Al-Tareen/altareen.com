## When to use
When your team jumps to features too fast and you need to map problems → opportunities → solutions.

## Inputs required
Desired outcome metric; research insights; opportunity list; solution ideas; experiment ideas.

## Output artifact
OST map linking outcome → opportunities → solutions → tests.

## Common mistakes
Diagram with no follow-through; no prioritization; solutions not tied to outcomes.
