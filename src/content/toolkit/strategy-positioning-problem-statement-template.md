## When to use
When people are proposing solutions but you can’t clearly state the problem, who has it, and why it matters.

## Inputs required
Evidence of pain (interviews, tickets, usage); who is impacted; current workflow; frequency/severity; business impact.

## Output artifact
Problem statement (who/what/why now); scope boundaries; success criteria; constraints.

## Common mistakes
Describing a solution; too broad; no evidence; no clear “done means.”
