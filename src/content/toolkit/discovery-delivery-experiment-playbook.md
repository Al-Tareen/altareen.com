## When to use
When you want to run experiments without chaos—clear hypotheses, guardrails, and decision rules.

## Inputs required
Hypothesis; success/guardrail metrics; traffic/sample plan; instrumentation; decision thresholds.

## Output artifact
Experiment plan; pre-registered success criteria; analysis template; ship/iterate/kill outcome.

## Common mistakes
No guardrails; moving goalposts; p-hacking; poor instrumentation.
