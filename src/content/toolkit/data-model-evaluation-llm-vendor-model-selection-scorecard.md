## When to use
When you’re choosing between vendors/models and need to balance quality, cost, latency, privacy, and lock-in.

## Inputs required
Requirements (quality/latency/cost/privacy); eval results; contract terms; data retention policies.

## Output artifact
Weighted scorecard; recommended vendor/model tiering; decision record + rationale.

## Common mistakes
Choosing by hype; skipping eval on real data; ignoring retention/compliance; no exit plan.
