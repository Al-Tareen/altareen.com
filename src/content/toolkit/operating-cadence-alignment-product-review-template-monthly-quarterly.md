## When to use
When you need a recurring forum to review outcomes, reset bets, and make decisions.

## Inputs required
KPI tree performance; roadmap/bets status; learnings; risks; resource constraints.

## Output artifact
Review agenda + decisions + updated bets + follow-ups.

## Common mistakes
Too many topics; no decisions; not tied to outcomes; no owners.
