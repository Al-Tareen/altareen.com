## When to use
When you need to clarify “why would anyone choose us?” or messaging feels feature-y and weak.

## Inputs required
JTBD + pains/gains; top alternatives; proof points; segmentation/ICP hypothesis.

## Output artifact
Pains/gains map; value prop claims; differentiation bullets; evidence list (why believe us).

## Common mistakes
Feature lists disguised as value; generic claims; no proof; not segment-specific.
