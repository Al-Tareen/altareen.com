## When to use
After a launch, incident, or miss—when you must learn and prevent repeats.

## Inputs required
Timeline; impact metrics; contributing factors; decisions made; logs/alerts (for AI).

## Output artifact
Retro/postmortem doc + corrective actions + owners + due dates.

## Common mistakes
Blame; no follow-through; superficial root cause; no systemic changes.
