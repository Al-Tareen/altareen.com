## When to use
When leaders need status and decisions—fast, metrics-driven, and with clear asks.

## Inputs required
KPI status; bet progress; risks/issues; asks/decisions needed; timeline changes.

## Output artifact
Exec update memo (outcomes-first) + clear asks.

## Common mistakes
Status without outcomes; hiding risks; no asks; too long.
