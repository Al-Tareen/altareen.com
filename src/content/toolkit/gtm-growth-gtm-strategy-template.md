## When to use
When you have a product/feature ready and need a plan to drive adoption in the target segment.

## Inputs required
ICP; positioning; channel plan; pricing; rollout plan; enablement needs.

## Output artifact
GTM plan with timeline, owners, messaging, channels, measurement.

## Common mistakes
“Launch and hope”; no channel strategy; ignores enablement/support.
