## When to use
When you need to communicate direction without committing to fake dates.

## Inputs required
Strategy bets; capacity constraints; dependency map; stakeholder needs.

## Output artifact
Roadmap view + narrative + assumptions.

## Common mistakes
Treated as commitments; too granular; dates without confidence.
