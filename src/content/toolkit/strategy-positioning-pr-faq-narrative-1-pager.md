## When to use
When you need exec buy-in and want to pressure-test clarity before spending engineering time.

## Inputs required
Problem statement; ICP; differentiation; core UX concept; risks/failure modes; success metrics.

## Output artifact
“Press release” narrative + FAQ (who/why/risks/non-goals/metrics/rollout).

## Common mistakes
Marketing fluff; avoids risks; unclear “why now”; no measurable success definition.
