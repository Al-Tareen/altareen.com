## When to use
When stakeholders ask for AI and you need to determine if AI is actually the right solution.

## Inputs required
Problem statement; baseline approach; data availability; accuracy needs; risk tolerance; cost constraints.

## Output artifact
AI suitability memo; recommendation (AI vs non-AI); constraints + gating requirements.

## Common mistakes
“AI because AI”; no baseline; ignores ops/cost; ignores risk.
