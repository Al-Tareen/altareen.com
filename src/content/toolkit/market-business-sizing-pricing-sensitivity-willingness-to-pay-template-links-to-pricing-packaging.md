## When to use
When you’re setting pricing/tiers and don’t know what customers will pay or what value metric fits.

## Inputs required
ICP interviews; value metrics; alternative costs; budgets/procurement constraints; pilot learnings.

## Output artifact
WTP bands by segment; recommended value metric; pricing experiments plan.

## Common mistakes
Asking “what would you pay?” directly; no segmentation; ignores procurement; no experiment plan.
