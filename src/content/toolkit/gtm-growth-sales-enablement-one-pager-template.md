## When to use
When sales is involved and needs crisp positioning + objections + proof to sell confidently.

## Inputs required
ICP; value prop; objections; proof points; pricing; key use cases.

## Output artifact
Battlecard-style 1-pager for sales.

## Common mistakes
Feature dump; no objections; no proof; vague ICP.
