## When to use
When you’re starting a new product/pivot and stakeholders are asking “what are we building and why?”

## Inputs required
Company strategy/mandate; target customer/ICP; core problem area; competitive context; constraints (tech/legal/budget).

## Output artifact
Vision statement; principles; strategic boundaries/non-goals; 3–5 strategic bets; success definition.

## Common mistakes
Inspirational fluff; no tradeoffs; ignores constraints; not connected to measurable outcomes.
