## When to use
When you’re betting on something uncertain and need to test what could kill the idea early.

## Inputs required
Assumptions list; impact if wrong; evidence level; test options.

## Output artifact
Assumption map; prioritized test plan; learning milestones.

## Common mistakes
Missing key assumptions; testing easy assumptions; no decision rules tied to tests.
