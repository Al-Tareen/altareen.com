## When to use
When engineering needs precise behavior, edge cases, and constraints beyond the PRD.

## Inputs required
PRD; user flows; edge cases; data schema needs; non-functional constraints (latency, security).

## Output artifact
Engineering-ready spec with behaviors, edge cases, APIs, UI rules.

## Common mistakes
Repeats PRD; missing edge cases; no non-functional requirements.
