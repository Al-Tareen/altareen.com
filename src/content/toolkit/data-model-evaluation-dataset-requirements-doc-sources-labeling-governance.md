## When to use
When you’re considering an AI feature and don’t know if you have the right data (or any usable data) to build it.

## Inputs required
Task definition; data inventory; privacy/security rules; labeling rubric; ownership + access.

## Output artifact
Data spec (fields, volume, quality); sourcing plan; labeling plan; governance policy.

## Common mistakes
Starting without data clarity; unclear ownership; weak labeling rubric; privacy ignored.
