## When to use
When teams disagree on what drives success or you need to diagnose why metrics moved.

## Inputs required
North Star; funnel/value model; instrumentation availability; segmentation.

## Output artifact
KPI tree linking drivers → outcome; ownership per branch.

## Common mistakes
Too complex; not causal; not operationalized; ignores segments.
