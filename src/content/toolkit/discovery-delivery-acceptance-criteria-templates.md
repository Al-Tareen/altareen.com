## When to use
When requirements are being interpreted differently by PM/Eng/QA and you need testable clarity.

## Inputs required
Requirements; expected behaviors; edge cases; failure behavior.

## Output artifact
Testable Given/When/Then criteria + quality thresholds.

## Common mistakes
Non-testable language; misses negative cases; not updated when scope changes.
