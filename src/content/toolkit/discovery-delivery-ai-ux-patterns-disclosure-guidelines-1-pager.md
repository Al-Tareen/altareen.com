## When to use
When users might overtrust the AI, or when inconsistent UI behavior (confidence, citations, refusals) would damage trust and adoption.

## Inputs required
Model/system limitations; uncertainty patterns; key failure modes; brand/legal requirements; user trust risks; UX flows (where AI appears); feedback channels.

## Output artifact
1-page UX policy: disclosure language, confidence/uncertainty cues, citations/source rules (if applicable), refusal/fallback behavior, user control (edit/undo), feedback/reporting, and “don’ts.”

## Common mistakes
Overpromising; hiding uncertainty; inconsistent refusal behavior; dumping raw model output; no user control; no feedback loop; not aligning with safety/guardrails.
