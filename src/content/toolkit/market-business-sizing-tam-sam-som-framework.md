## When to use
When you need to justify that the opportunity is big enough to invest in (or to prioritize vs other bets).

## Inputs required
Segment definition; pricing assumptions; adoption curve; competitor penetration; bottoms-up drivers.

## Output artifact
TAM/SAM/SOM model with assumptions; sensitivity ranges; prioritized segment sizing.

## Common mistakes
Hand-wavy top-down only; mixing TAM with reachable revenue; no assumptions; no sensitivity analysis.
