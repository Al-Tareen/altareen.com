## When to use
When launch is done but users aren’t “getting value” fast enough (activation is weak)

## Inputs required
Activation definition; key actions; segments; onboarding flow; instrumentation.

## Output artifact
Activation funnel; targets; experiment backlog.

## Common mistakes
Wrong “activation” event; mixing adoption with activation; ignores segments.
